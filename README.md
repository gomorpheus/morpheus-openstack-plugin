# Morpheus Openstack Plugin

This library provides an integration between Openstack and Morpheus. 

### Status
The plugin can be configured to point to an Openstack environment. Once configured, the sync process will pull in roles, projects, hosts, images, networks and subnets into Morpheus. 

### TODO
Sync: security groups, server groups, routers, ip pools, floating ips, network availability zones, and virtual machines.
Provisioning: provisioning of virtual machines
